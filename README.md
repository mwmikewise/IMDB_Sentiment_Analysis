Sentiment analysis on IMDB movie reviews

Problem Statement:
A movie studio has had a few box office flops, and wishes to see exactly what people did not like when watching their films. They are hoping to look at bad reviews and see what problems they can fix in order to produce a blockbuster hit. The studio has provided raw data of reviews from IMDB, as well as whether people felt the movie was good or not. As a data scientist, it is our job to clean up the reviews and perform sentiment analysis to catagorize reviews as positive or negative. The studio can then look at the negative reviews and see what to avoid for future productions. They also wish to be able to use the sentiment analysis on reviews from other sites if they so choose.
